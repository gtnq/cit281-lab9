You will be working through the GitHub Learning Lab Create a release based workflow (Links to an external site.) course.

The GitHub Learning Lab courses are self-directed repos added to your GitHub account. The repos represent individual courses with a series of steps to follow to learn the course material. Each course is isolated to the course repo added to your GitHub account. Some steps will hide the next steps until a specific action or change to the repo has been completed.

Lab goals and outcomes:

Part 1: Create Learning Lab course/repo within your GitHub account

Part 2: Practice exiting and returning to the course from course repo

Part 3: Work through course

Part 4: Download completed course repo as deliverable

This lab will include a deliverable to be submitted with Project 7.


Important: The GitHub Learning Lab course for this lab has an expected completion time of 67 minutes, so you are not expected to complete the course during the lab time. Also, the course consists of fourteen steps, and you should be able to get through at least step ten.

Tip: The course content will supply links back to your GitHub repo for the course. You should click on the links and open a new tab/page, rather than navigate away from the course.
